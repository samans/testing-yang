        An NR cell transmits SS/PBCH block and always requires downlink 
        transmission at a certain carrier frequency with a certain channel 
        bandwidth. Transmission may be performed from multiple sector-carriers 
        using different transmission points, and these may be configured with 
        different carrier frequencies and channel bandwidths, as long as they 
        are aligned to the cell's downlink resource grids as defined in 
        subclause 4.4 in TS 38.211. The values of arfcnDL and bSChannelBwDL 
        attributes define the resource grids which each sector-carrier needs to 
        be aligned to. See subclauses 5.3 and 5.4.2 of TS 38.104 for definitions 
        of BS channel bandwidth and NR-ARFCN, respectively.
        
        An NR cell requires an uplink in order to provide initial access. In 
        case of TDD, the values of arfcnUL and bSChannelBwUL have to always be 
        set to the same values as for the corresponding DL attributes. For both 
        FDD and TDD, the arfcnUL and bSChannelBwUL define uplink resource grids 
        to which each sector-carrier needs to align to.
        
        An NR cell can in addition be configured with a supplementary uplink, 
        which has its own arfcnSUL and bSChannelBwSUL, which define resource 
        grids for supplementary uplink sector-carriers.
        
        Each of downlink, uplink and supplementary uplink (if configured) need 
        an initial bandwidth part (BWP), which defines resources to be used by 
        UEs during and immediately after initial access. Additional BWPs can be
