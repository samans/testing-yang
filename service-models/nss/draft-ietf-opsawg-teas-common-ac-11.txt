            A Common YANG Data Model for Attachment Circuits
                  draft-ietf-opsawg-teas-common-ac-11

Abstract

   The document specifies a common Attachment Circuits (ACs) YANG
   module, which is designed with the intent to be reusable by other
   models.  For example, this common model can be reused by service
   models to expose ACs as a service, service models that require
   binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models to
   provision ACs, etc.

1.  Introduction

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points (e.g., Service Functions (SFs), Customer
   Premises Equipment (CPEs), Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs),
   data centers gateways, or Internet Exchange Points).  A connectivity
   service is basically about ensuring data transfer received from (or
   destined to) a given terminating point to (or from) other terminating



Boucadair, et al.       Expires 15 November 2024                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft       Common Attachment Circuit YANG             May 2024


   points that belong to the same customer/service, an interconnection
   node, or an ancillary node.  A set of objectives for the connectivity
   service may eventually be negotiated and agreed upon between a
   customer a network provider.  For that data transfer to take place
   within the provider network, it is assumed that adequate setup is
   provisioned over the links that connect customer terminating points
   and a provider network (a Provider Edge (PE), typically) so that data
   can be successfully exchanged over these links.  The required setup
   is referred to in this document as Attachment Circuits (ACs), while
   the underlying link is referred to as "bearer".

   This document adheres to the definition of an attachment circuit as
   provided in Section 1.2 of [RFC4364], especially:

      Routers can be attached to each other, or to end systems, in a
      variety of different ways: PPP connections, ATM Virtual Circuits
      (VCs), Frame Relay VCs, ethernet interfaces, Virtual Local Area
      Networks (VLANs) on ethernet interfaces, GRE tunnels, Layer 2
      Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels, IPsec tunnels, etc.  We will
      use the term "attachment circuit" to refer generally to some such
      means of attaching to a router.  An attachment circuit may be the
      sort of connection that is usually thought of as a "data link", or
      it may be a tunnel of some sort; what matters is that it be
      possible for two devices to be network layer peers over the
      attachment circuit.

   When a customer requests a new value-added service, the service can
   be bound to existing attachment circuits or trigger the instantiation
   of new attachment circuits.  Whether these attachment circuits are
   specific to a given service or be shared to deliver a variety of
   services is deployment-specific.

   An example of attachment circuits is depicted in Figure 1.  A
   Customer Edge (CE) may be a physical node or a logical entity.  A CE
   is seen by the network as a peer Service Attachment Point (SAP)
   [RFC9408].  CEs may be dedicated to one single service (e.g., Layer 3
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Layer 2 VPN) or host multiple
   services (e.g., Service Functions [RFC7665]).  A single AC (as seen
   by a network provider) may be bound to one or multiple peer SAPs
   (e.g., "CE#1" and "CE#2").  For example, and as discussed in
   [RFC4364], multiple CEs can be attached to a PE over the same
   attachment circuit.  This is typically implemented if the Layer 2
   infrastructure between the CE and the network provides a multipoint
   service.  The same CE may terminate multiple ACs.  These ACs may be
   over the same or distinct bearers.

                         Figure 1: Examples of ACs

   This document specifies a common module ("ietf-ac-common") for
   attachment circuits (Section 5).  The model is designed with the
   intent to be reusable by other models and, therefore, ensure
   consistent AC structures among modules that manipulate ACs.  For
   example, the common model can be reused by service models to expose
   AC-as-a-Service (ACaaS) (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]), service models that
   require binding a service to a set of ACs (e.g., Network Slice
   Service [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang])), network models
   to provision ACs (e.g., [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]),
   device models, etc.

   The common AC module eases data inheritance between modules (e.g.,
   from service to network models as per [RFC8969]).

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   LxSM refers to both the Layer 2 Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466] and
   the Layer 3 Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299].

   LxNM refers to both the Layer 2 Network Model (L2NM) [RFC9291] and
   the Layer 3 Network Model (L3NM) [RFC9182].

   This document uses the following terms:

   Bearer:  A physical or logical link that connects a customer node (or
      site) to a provider network.

      A bearer can be a wireless or wired link.  One or multiple
      technologies can be used to build a bearer.  The bearer type can
      be specified by a customer.

      The operator allocates a unique bearer reference to identify a
      bearer within its network (e.g., customer line identifier).  Such
      a reference can be retrieved by a customer and then used in
      subsequent service placement requests to unambiguously identify
      where a service is to be bound.

      The concept of bearer can be generalized to refer to the required
      underlying connection for the provisioning of an attachment
      circuit.

      One or multiple attachment circuits may be hosted over the same
      bearer (e.g., multiple Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) on the
      same bearer that is provided by a physical link).

   Network controller:  Denotes a functional entity responsible for the
      management of the service provider network.  One or multiple
      network controllers can be deployed in a service provider network.

   Service orchestrator:  Refers to a functional entity that interacts
      with the customer of a network service.

      A service orchestrator is typically responsible for the attachment
      circuits, the Provider Edge (PE) selection, and requesting the
      activation of the requested services to a network controller.

      A service orchestrator may interact with one or more network
      controllers.

   Service provider network:  A network that is able to provide network
      services (e.g., L2VPN, L3VPN, or Network Slice Services
      [RFC9543]).

   Service provider:  A service provider that offers network services
      (e.g., L2VPN, L3VPN, or Network Slice Services).

   *  "ietf-bearer-svc" (Section 5.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit])

   *  "ietf-ac-ntw" ([I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit])

   *  "ietf-ac-glue" ([I-D.ietf-opsawg-ac-lxsm-lxnm-glue])

                  |                                    |
                  +----------- ietf-ac-glue -----------+

                          Figure 2: AC Data Models

   "ietf-ac-common" is imported by "ietf-bearer-svc", "ietf-ac-svc", and
   "ietf-ac-ntw".  Bearers managed using "ietf-bearer-svc" may be
   referenced in the service ACs managed using "ietf-ac-svc".
   Similarly, a bearer managed using "ietf-bearer-svc" may list the set
   of ACs that use that bearer.  In order to ease correlation between an
   AC service requests and the actual AC provisioned in the network,
   "ietf-ac-ntw" uses the AC references exposed by "ietf-ac-svc".  To
   bind Layer 2 VPN or Layer 3 VPN services with ACs, "ietf-ac-glue"
   augments the LxSM and LxNM with AC service references exposed by
   "ietf-ac-svc" and AC network references exposed by "ietf-ac-ntw".

4.  Description of the AC Common YANG Module

   The full tree diagram of the module can be generated using the
   "pyang" tool [PYANG] with "-f tree --tree-print-groupings" command-
   line parameters.  That tree is not included here because it is too
   long (Section 3.3 of [RFC8340]).  Instead, subtrees are provided for
   the reader's convenience.

      The full tree of the "ietf-ac-common" module is available at
      [AC-Common-Tree].

4.1.  Features

   The module defines the following features:

   'layer2-ac':  Used to indicate support of ACs with Layer 2
      properties.

   'layer3-ac':  Used to indicate support of ACs with Layer 3
      properties.

   'server-assigned-reference':  Used to indicate support of server-
      generated references to access relevant resources.

      For example, a bearer request is first created using a name which
      is assigned by the client, but if this feature is supported, the
      request will also include a server-generated reference.  That
      reference can be used when requesting the creating of an AC over
      the existing bearer.

4.2.  Identities

   The module defines a set of identities, including the following:

   'address-allocation-type':  Used to specify the IP address allocation
      type in an AC.  For example, this identity can used to indicate
      whether the provider network provides DHCP service, DHCP relay, or
      static addressing.  Note that for the IPv6 case, Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] can be used.

   'local-defined-next-hop':  Used to specify next hop actions.  For
      example, this identity can be used to indicate an action to
      discard traffic for a given destination or treat traffic towards
      addresses within the specified next-hop prefix as though they are
      connected to a local link.

   'l2-tunnel-type':  Uses to control the Layer 2 tunnel selection for
      an AC.  The current version supports indicating pseudowire,
      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and Virtual eXtensible Local
      Area Network (VXLAN).

   'precedence-type':  Used to indicate the redundancy type when
      requesting ACs.  For example, this identity can be used to tag
      primary and secondary ACs.

   'bgp-capability':  Used to indicate a BGP capability [RFC5492].
      Examples of BGP capabilities are Multiprotocol extensions for
      BGP-4 [RFC4760], route refresh [RFC2918], graceful restart
      [RFC4724], or ADD-PATH [RFC7911].

Internet-Draft       Common Attachment Circuit YANG             May 2024


   'role':  Used to indicate the type of an AC: User-to-Network
      Interface (UNI), Network-to-Network Interface (NNI), or public
      NNI.

   New administrative status types:  In addition to the status types
      already defined in [RFC9181], this document defines:

      *  'awaiting-validation' to report that a request is pending an
         adiministrator approval.

      *  'awaiting-processing' to report that a request was approved and
         validated, but is awaiting more processing before activation.

      *  'admin-prohibited' to report that a request cannot be handled
         because of administrative policies.

      *  'rejected' to report that a request was rejected reasons not
         covered by the other status types.

4.3.  Reusable Groupings

   The module also defines a set of reusable groupings, including the
   following:

   'op-instructions' (Figure 3):  Defines a set of parameters to specify
      scheduling instructions and report related events for a service
      request (e.g., AC or bearer).

     grouping service-status:
       +-- status
          +-- admin-status
          |  +-- status?        identityref
          |  +--ro last-change?   yang:date-and-time
          +--ro oper-status
             +--ro status?        identityref
             +--ro last-change?   yang:date-and-time
     grouping op-instructions:
       +-- requested-start?   yang:date-and-time
       +-- requested-stop?    yang:date-and-time
       +--ro actual-start?      yang:date-and-time
       +--ro actual-stop?       yang:date-and-time

                Figure 3: Operational Instructions Grouping

   Layer 2 encapsulations (Figure 4):  Groupings for the following
      encapsulation schemes are supported: dot1Q, QinQ, and priority-
      tagged.

   Layer 2 tunnel services (Figure 4):  These groupings are used to
      define Layer 2 tunnel services that may be needed for the
      activation of an AC.  Examples of supported Layer 2 services are
      the pseudowire (Section 6.1 of [RFC8077]), VPLS, or VXLAN
      [RFC7348].

      the module supports the following routing protocols: BGP
      [RFC4271], OSPF [RFC4577] or [RFC6565], IS-IS
      [ISO10589][RFC1195][RFC5308], and RIP [RFC2453].  For all
      supported routing protocols, 'address-family' indicates whether
      IPv4, IPv6, or both address families are to be activated.  For
      example, this parameter is used to determine whether RIPv2
      [RFC2453], RIP Next Generation (RIPng), or both are to be enabled
      [RFC2080].  More details about supported routing groupings are
      provided hereafter:

      *  Authentication: These groupings include the required
         information to manage the authentication of OSPF, IS-IS, BGP,
         and RIP.  Similar to [RFC9182], this version of the common AC
         model assumes that parameters specific to the TCP-AO are
         preconfigured as part of the key chain that is referenced in
         the model.  No assumption is made about how such a key chain is
         preconfigured.  However, the structure of the key chain should
         cover data nodes beyond those in [RFC8177], mainly SendID and
         RecvID (Section 3.1 of [RFC5925]).

      *  BGP peer groups: Includes a set of parameters to identify a BGP
         peer group.  Such a group can be defined by providing a local
         AS Number (ASN), a customer's ASN, and the address families to
         be activated for this group.  BGP peer groups can be identified
         by a name.

      *  Basic parameters: These groupings include the minimal set of
         routing configuration that is required for the activation of
         OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, and RIP.

      *  Static routing: Parameters to configure an entry of a list of
         IP static routing entries.

      The 'redundancy-group' grouping lists the groups to which an AC
      belongs [RFC9181].  For example, the 'group-id' is used to
      associate redundancy or protection constraints of ACs.

    grouping bgp-authentication:
       +-- authentication
          +-- enabled?           boolean
          +-- keying-material

6.  Security Considerations

   This section uses the template described in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

Internet-Draft       Common Attachment Circuit YANG             May 2024


   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-ac-common" module defines a set of identities, types, and
   groupings.  These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules.  The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that
   are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.

   YANG modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
   information (e.g., 'ipv6-lan-prefixes' or 'ipv4-lan-prefixes').
   Disclosing such information may be considered a violation of the
   customer-provider trust relationship.

   Several groupings ('bgp-authentication', 'ospf-authentication',
   'isis-authentication', and 'rip-authentication') rely upon [RFC8177]
   for authentication purposes.  As such, modules that will reuse these
   groupings will inherit the security considerations discussed in
   Section 5 of [RFC8177].  Also, these groupings support supplying
   explicit keys as strings in ASCII format.  The use of keys in
   hexadecimal string format would afford greater key entropy with the
   same number of key- string octets.  However, such a format is not
   included in this version of the common AC model, because it is not
   supported by the underlying device modules (e.g., [RFC8695]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ac-common
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry:
